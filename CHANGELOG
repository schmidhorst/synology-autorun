 - Ability to restrict the allowed scripts on the USB drives to scripts with pre-registered hash values. (similar to heandr V1.9)
 - In case of using exit code 100 to eject the USB drive now a further script can be called afterwards e.g. to power down the USB drive (if eject was successfully)

Known Issues:
 - The Web pages do not use the language setting of the actual user but the general DSM language setting 
   as the file /volume1/@userpreference/<user>/usersettings is not accessible.  

1.8.x/1.9
  Forks from Jip-Hop (https://github.com/Jip-Hop/synology-autorun) and JC-23 (https://github.com/JC-23/synology-autorun)
  added: optional feature to verify sha256 fingerprints of scripts before running them

 !!! A MANUAL STEP IS REQUIRED AFTER THE INSTALLATION !!!
 Third Party packages are restricted by Synology in DSM 7. Since autorun does require root
 permission to perform its job an additional manual step is required after the installation.
 SSH to your NAS (as an admin user) and execute the following command:
   sudo cp /var/packages/autorun/conf/privilege.root /var/packages/autorun/conf/privilege
