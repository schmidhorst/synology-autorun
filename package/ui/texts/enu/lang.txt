settingFingerprint="The with root access executed script is a security risk, especially if it's configured with location on the external storage. Execution can be restricted to scripts matching previously registered SHA256 checksum.<br>0: No restriction. Previously registered checksums are preserved.<br>1: If there are previously registered checksums, they are deleted. The 1st script with it's checksum is registered as allowed checksum.<br>2: All scripts are allowed and there checksums are registered, if not already registered before.<br>3: Only scripts with previously registered checksums are allowed."
settingSecurityWarning="<span style="color:red"><b>Attention:</b></span> Combining script variant a) (script on external USB/eSATA device) with fingerprint setting 0 or 2 can be a critical security risk: Scripts with arbitrary content on the external storage device are executed when plugged in and have access to everything! Plugging it in can be enough to destroy or steal the data on your Synology NAS!"
settingScript="Variant a: The script is located in the root directory of the external storage device and set as executable for the user 'root'. Given is the pure script name without any path or slash.<br>Variant b: The script is given with it's full path and is located on the NAS.<br>It gets the mount point of the device (e.g. /volumeUSB1/usbshare/) as the first parameter (\$1) and the device partition (e.g. usb1p1) as the second (\$2). It needs to be executable for 'root'. For 'root' is in DSM 7 the shell 'ash' used. But /bin/ash may be a link to 'bash' (at least on a DS220+). The script it's started with an empty environment! So no PATH is set. You have to use for each command the full path (e.g. /bin/echo "...", /bin/printf ...). Your script may stop with the exit code 2 if a command is not found due to a missing path. In the first lines of your script, you may use an 'unset PATH' to have in debugging runs of the script the same conditions. Or you add a line like 'PATH=/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/syno/sbin:/usr/syno/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin' to the beginning of your script."
settingScriptAfter="If the script exits with some defined exit codes, then autorun will eject that storage device and afterwards call this 2nd script. This is optional. Typical usage is to power down an HDD with external supply via a smart power adapter."
settingTries="The time (in seconds) how long autorun should search for a mounted drive. Increase this value when you get the 'unable to find mount point' error."
settingWait="An additional wait time (in seconds) after mounting is detected before starting the script. In some cases a few seconds delay is required for proper drive access."
settingBeep="If set to 'true', there is a short beep when a script is found. And a triple long beep in case of an error."
settingLedStatus="The status LED can be used to show the script status.<br>0: The status LED is not used by this package.<br>1: 1: Green while running, green flashing during eject, OFF if finished with 0 or one of the codes defined for ejection, orange flashing for other results or failed ejection<br/>2: Green flashing while script is running or ejecting, green if finished with 0 or one of the codes defined for ejection, orange flashing for other results or failed eject<br/>3: Green while script is running and during eject, OFF when finished, orange flashing if ejection failed."

settingNoDsmMessageReturnCodes="Normally there is a DSM desktop message generated after your script is finished. The message contains the return code of your script and the remaining free space on the storage device. If your script exits with one of the codes given here, then no such message is generated. A entry in the logfile of the package is still generated."
settingEjectTimeout="If in case of an exit code configured for device ejection the external drive cannot be ejected (as it's busy), this gives the timeout in seconds before terminating ejection tries with error."
settingLogMaxLines="To avoid, that too much space is occupied by the logfiles, the elder half of the files is deleted if the line count has reached the given number."
settingLogVerbose="Several detail levels are available for writing messages to the debug log file: 1 ... 8. The higher the value the more details."
settingNotifyUsers="The package generates desktop notifications, which are shown to a configurable user or user group.

In the general tab set an useful name and select 'root' as the user. As 'Schedule' you can select a date in the past and the 'Do not repeat'.
