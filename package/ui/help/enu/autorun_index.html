    <h1>Autorun</h1>
    <p>
    The "Autorun" package can trigger an action when an external disk is plugged into a Synology station. This is often very useful for automated copying of data. 
    At least in DSM version 7.1, such an event option is missing in the task scheduler. 
    There are only "Startup" and "Shutdown" as events in the "Triggered Tasks", but no "External USB storage inserted" or similar.
    </p>
    <p>
    With "action" is meant first of all the execution of a BASH shell script. 
    The script can then copy files back and forth between the disk station and the disk using commands like
     <span style="font-family: 'Courier New'; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none;">rsync</span>. 
     Or the script can e.g. also start a task defined in the task scheduler.
     </p>
    <p>
    As an additional action, the disk can also be ejected after the action is completed. 
    Since this means that the data on the external data medium is no longer directly accessible, this provides a certain degree of protection
     for the data on the external data medium against destruction, for example by ransomware. 
     However, since the data medium can also be re-integrated into the system via software, it is not complete protection.
    </p>
    <p>
    Even better ransomware protection can be achieved in the following way: Use an external data medium with its own power supply, 
    as is common with 3.5-inch USB hard disks. The power supply is operated via a smart socket. This smart socket is then switched off after 
    the data medium has been ejected. As long as ransomware doesn't override this implementation, the external data medium that is 
    disconnected from the system in this way is protected. 
    <b>
    Warning: 
    </b>
    While the external disk is mounted for an update, there is practically no protection against ransomware that could heve entered your system before! 
    Therefore, use always at least two disks alternately for backups!
